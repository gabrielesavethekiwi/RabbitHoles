    "# How are integers stored in Python?\n",

    "I stumbled upon a very curious python function, 'id()'. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `id()` function in Python returns a unique identifier for an object. On CPython (the most common implementation of Python), this identifier is typically the memory address where the object is stored. \n",
    "\n",
    "`id(x)` provides a unique identifier for the object `x` during its lifetime — the value of the identifier will remain the same provided that 'x' exists and is not garbage-collected or reassigned. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, Python, to my (modest) knowledge, is a terrible fit for direct memory manipulations due to its notorious overheads and abstraction layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, I wanted to perform a simple check to verify whether `id()` truly returns a memory address. Specifically, I wanted to see if I could \"reverse engineer\" the value stored in a variable by inspecting the data type and accessing the memory directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is affirmative. I found reaching the answer — without referring to CPython's source code for PyLongObject —  to be a fun problem solving exercise. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, navigating the source code at https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Objects/longobject.c is no joke."
